    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p id="summary">
      I am an extremely creative personality who loves to try new things and
      always gives my all. From being a published poet to starting my own small
      business, Bagheeraâ€™s Gold on Etsy, I excel at the things I am passionate
      about. When I decided to travel the world, I moved to South Korea and from
      there travelled Asia. After five years in Korea, I moved to Saudi Arabia
      to teach English to Saudi women who were studying medicine. Teaching these
      beautiful women inspired me to push myself even harder to follow my
      dreams. Working in tech has long been a goal of mine. I see how technology
      all around me helps people, especially in times when we are so isolated.
      Instead of seeing this as a time of uncertainty, I have seen it as a time
      to try new things and to gain a new set of skills, a time to pour my focus
      into a new passion, one that helps shape the world and one that allows me
      to continue learning and growing.
